# You don't need to know anything before to learn programming in this course!
In this course you will learn to programming from scratch in JavaScript, good practices and testing with Jest.

First of all, I invite you to visit the Course Info [clicking here](https://jorgesarricolea.com/javascript-course), where you can not only get more information about this course but also have Premium access so that I can personally teach you how to program step-by-step.

## Description
In this course, I will teach you how to programming from scratch in JavaScript. I will teach you the fundamentals stuff of Vanilla JavaScript, and how to implement a library like jQuery. A plus in this course you will learn to do testing with Jest Framework. Don't know what is Jest? Don't worry, you'll.

## Getting Started and workspace
You can clone this repository locally and start working with it, which is my recommendation, but feel free to create it from scratch on your computer.

## Stages
The course is divided into 10 stages, a total of 23 hours, here you will see a guide on how this course is divided and how we will progress.

### Stage 1. Train your logic to program. (1 hour).
The basic programming functions are a set of fundamental concepts that are used in almost any programming language. These functions include:

- Variables: A variable is a space in the computer's memory that is used to store a value. Variables can have different data types, such as numbers, text strings, or boolean values.

- Operators: Operators are symbols or keywords that are used to perform mathematical or logical operations. Arithmetic operators include addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Logical operators include AND, OR, and NOT.

- Control structures: Control structures are code blocks that are used to control the flow of execution of a program. Control structures include loops (for, while, do-while) and conditional structures (if-else, switch-case).

- Functions: Functions are code blocks that can be called from anywhere in the program and perform a specific task. Functions can have input parameters and can return output values.

- Arrays: Arrays are a data structure that is used to store multiple values of the same type in a single variable. Arrays can be one or multi-dimensional.

- Input/Output: Input/output refers to how programs interact with the user or with other programs. Programs can receive data from the user through standard input (such as the keyboard) or through files. Output can be sent to the user through standard output (such as the screen) or through files.

- These basic programming functions are used together to create more complex programs and perform specific tasks. It is important to understand these basic functions before moving on to more advanced programming.

### Stage 2. Flowcharts. (1 hour).
Flowcharts are important tools in programming as they aid in designing, planning, and communicating the logical flow of a program. They facilitate debugging, code maintenance, and performance optimization. They are also useful for learning and documentation purposes, providing a clear visual representation of the program's structure and logic.

### Stage 3. Prepare workspace. (1 - 2 hours).
You need a good environment to work efficiently. The right programs and tools that I recommend in this course are the ones that have worked perfectly for me and the tech industry.

- VSCode installation
- Java Programming Languaje
- Python Programming Languaje
- Git and GitHub installation
- Some extensions to VSCode

Here is a list of extensions that I recommend you install on your VSCode:

- [Error Lens](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=usernamehw.errorlens)
- [Ident Rainbow](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=oderwat.indent-rainbow)
- [Material Icon Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=PKief.material-icon-theme)
- [Trailing Spaces](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=shardulm94.trailing-spaces)

### Stage 4. Fundamentals of Vanilla JavaScript. (5 hours).
Vanilla JavaScript refers to using pure JavaScript without any additional libraries or frameworks. It is the core and fundamental language used for web development and allows you to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM), handle events, and perform various operations on web pages. Here are some key fundamentals of vanilla JavaScript:

- Variables and Data Types: You can declare variables using the var, let, or const keywords. JavaScript has several built-in data types, including numbers, strings, booleans, objects, arrays, and null/undefined.

- Operators: JavaScript supports a wide range of operators, such as arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /), assignment operators (=, +=, -=, etc.), comparison operators (<, >, <=, >=, ==, ===, !=, !==), and logical operators (&&, ||, !).

- Control Flow: JavaScript provides control flow statements like if...else, switch, and for/while loops to control the execution of code based on conditions.

- Functions: You can define functions in JavaScript using the function keyword. Functions can accept parameters and return values. They are reusable blocks of code that can be invoked multiple times.

- DOM Manipulation: The Document Object Model (DOM) represents the structure of an HTML document. Vanilla JavaScript allows you to access and manipulate the DOM elements by using methods such as getElementById, querySelector, createElement, appendChild, removeChild, and more.

- Events: JavaScript enables you to handle events triggered by user interactions (e.g., clicks, key presses). You can use event listeners to attach functions that execute when specific events occur.

- Error Handling: JavaScript provides mechanisms for error handling, such as try...catch blocks, which allow you to catch and handle exceptions gracefully.

- Arrays and Objects: JavaScript has built-in support for arrays and objects. Arrays can store multiple values, while objects can hold key-value pairs.

- Asynchronous Programming: JavaScript supports asynchronous programming using features like callbacks, promises, and async/await. These mechanisms help handle time-consuming operations, such as making API requests, without blocking the execution of other code.

Local Storage: Vanilla JavaScript provides the localStorage object, allowing you to store data locally within the browser. This can be useful for persisting user preferences or caching data.

These are just some of the fundamental concepts of vanilla JavaScript. Mastering these fundamentals will provide a strong foundation for building more complex web applications and understanding JavaScript frameworks and libraries.

### Stage 5. Libraries like jQuery. (2 hours).
jQuery is a popular JavaScript library that simplifies HTML document traversal, event handling, animating, and AJAX interactions for web development. It was created to address cross-browser compatibility issues and provide developers with a concise and efficient way to interact with the Document Object Model (DOM) and handle common tasks.

### Stage 6. "Hello, World" and first algorithms. (5 hours).
In this course, we will carry out the programming of basic and intermediate algorithms so that you can better understand the concepts and practice your programming logic. This will help you establish a solid foundation and later on, you can learn new technologies and continue learning as you progress.

### Stage 7. Project in Mars, doing a calculator. (3 hours).
We are going to develop a simple calculator where you will ask the user to enter their weight, and the result will show the weight that the user would have on the planet Mars. Don't know how to do it yet? Get ready to learn how to do it.

### Stage 8. What is Node.js? (1 hour).
Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to execute JavaScript code on the server-side. Unlike traditional JavaScript, which runs in web browsers, Node.js enables JavaScript to be executed as a standalone application on a server. In this course, it is necessary to install Node.js in order to perform testing.

### Stage 9. What is Testing and Jest Framework? (1 hour).
Testing refers to the process of evaluating a software system or its components to ensure that it functions correctly and meets the expected requirements. It involves executing the code with various test cases and validating the results to identify any defects or errors.

Jest is a popular JavaScript testing framework that is widely used for testing JavaScript applications, including Node.js projects, React components, and other JavaScript libraries. It is maintained by Facebook and provides an intuitive and powerful testing environment.

### Stage 10. Doing a Technical Test! (1 - 2 hours).
This is a common technical test that is required when applying for a web developer job. We will put into practice everything you have learned in this course. Are you ready for the test?
